How to Host Your Website (step-by-step)

1) Choose hosting model
- Static site hosting: Best for sites built with Vite/React when pre-rendered or static (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting, Cloudflare Pages, S3+CloudFront).
- Server/Node hosting: If you need a backend (Express, APIs), use Heroku-alternatives (Render, Railway), DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, or Azure App Service.
- Jamstack/SSR: For server-side rendering or SSG consider Next.js on Vercel, or prerender services if staying with SPA.

2) Get a domain name
- Register via registrars: Namecheap, Google Domains, GoDaddy, Cloudflare.
- Configure DNS: Add `A`, `CNAME`, and `TXT` (for verification) records as required by your host.

3) Prepare the site for production
- Build the app: `npm run build` (Vite will output `dist/` by default).
- Ensure static files are referenced with absolute or relative paths that will work on the host.
- Add `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` to the site root (we generated `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` in the project root). Copy them to the published root.
- Add Google verification meta tag to `index.html` (already added). Alternatively use DNS TXT verification.
- Optimize assets: compress images, enable `srcset` and `loading="lazy"`, minify CSS/JS.

4) Enable HTTPS
- Most hosts provide automatic HTTPS (Let's Encrypt). Ensure you configure custom domain and enable HTTPS/force-redirect to HTTPS.

5) Deploy to popular hosts (quick guides)
- Netlify (static):
  - Connect your GitHub/GitLab repo or drag-and-drop `dist/` folder.
  - Set build command: `npm run build` and publish directory: `dist`.
  - Add custom domain in Netlify settings and enable HTTPS.
- Vercel (static/SSR):
  - Connect repo; Vercel auto-detects frameworks. Set project root and build settings if needed.
  - For Next.js use Vercel for SSR/SSG.
- Firebase Hosting (static + CDN):
  - `npm i -g firebase-tools`
  - `firebase login` then `firebase init hosting` then `firebase deploy` (choose `dist` as public folder).
- GitHub Pages (simple static):
  - Push `dist` to `gh-pages` branch and set Pages source in repo settings.
- AWS S3 + CloudFront (static with CDN):
  - Upload `dist/` to S3 bucket, enable static website hosting, create CloudFront distribution, attach custom domain and certificate (AWS Certificate Manager).
- DigitalOcean App Platform / Droplets (server):
  - For Node servers, deploy via App Platform or a Droplet, configure environment variables and process manager (PM2).

6) Configure DNS to point your domain to the host
- For static hosts you'll typically add an `A` record or `CNAME` record per host docs.
- If using Cloudflare for DNS, set the proxy (orange cloud) appropriately — for some hosts you should leave it disabled until verified.

7) Verify and submit to Google
- Verify site ownership in Google Search Console:
  - Option A: Meta tag in `index.html` (already added).
  - Option B: DNS TXT record provided by Google.
- In Search Console > Sitemaps: submit `https://www.yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`.
- Use URL Inspection to request indexing for important pages.

8) Set up monitoring and analytics
- Add Google Analytics / GA4 or other analytics for traffic tracking.
- Use Google Search Console to monitor coverage, performance, and enhancements.

9) Improve search engine visibility
- Ensure unique `title` and `meta description` per page.
- Add JSON-LD structured data (`Product`, `BreadcrumbList`) on product pages (we added Product JSON-LD in `ProductDetailPage.tsx`).
- Fix Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID) using Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights.

10) Optional (e-commerce specific)
- Google Merchant Center: create a product feed or use structured data to appear in Shopping.
- SSL, CORS, secure cookies, payment gateway configuration (Razorpay/Stripe) as needed.

11) Troubleshooting
- If pages not indexed: ensure `robots.txt` allows crawling and sitemap is submitted.
- For SPA routes: server should serve `index.html` for unknown paths (or use clean URLs/SSR/SSG). Hash routes (`#/product/1`) are less ideal for indexing — consider migrating to pretty routes.
- If images fail to load on host, verify paths (spaces and percent-encoding) and that static assets are uploaded.

12) Useful commands (PowerShell)
- Build and generate sitemap/robots:
  ```powershell
  npm install
  npm run build
  $env:BASE_URL='https://www.yourrealdomain.com'; npm run generate-all
  ```

13) Next steps you can ask me to do
- Regenerate `sitemap.xml`/`robots.txt` with your real domain (tell me domain).
- Add category/product pages to the sitemap differently if you move to pretty URLs.
- Create a small deployment guide for a specific host (Netlify/Vercel/AWS) with exact steps.
